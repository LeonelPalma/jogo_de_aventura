<div align="center"> <h2>Customer Registration System</h2></div>

<div>
<p>This project was developed in order to allow the user to register based on the information requested by a form.</p>
<p>It aims to finalize the registration, with some criteria as a rule, only with the completion of all the fields present.</p>
<p>An algorithm has been implemented to validate such data, so that it makes it impossible for the user to register, for example, two records with the same name or e-mail, also validating whether the email and phone are valid.</p>
<p>When registering a new user, it is included in a table with its data filled in, also having the possibility to perform the deletion of the same.</p>
<p>This project was developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.</p>
